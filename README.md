Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a natural language processing technique used to determine the emotional tone behind a text. It involves analyzing a piece of text, such as a review or a social media post, to understand the sentiment expressed within it. The goal of sentiment analysis is to classify the text as positive, negative, or neutral, based on the emotional content conveyed by the words used. This technique is commonly used in customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, and market research to gain insights into the opinions and attitudes of individuals towards products, services, or topics.
